- Intro
  - saw how fast a coworker was navigating
  - wanted to engage better with daily tooling
- First Steps
  - followed iterm/tmux terminal tutorial
  - practiced vimtutor
- Intermediate game
  - found myself wanting better code sifting/sense
  - better theming
  - didn't like spending time with configuration
- Vsvim
  - loved modal editing but missed ide
  - best of both worlds
- Vsvim cons
  - doesnt support vimrc file
  - since emulated, not quite the same feel
  - combo of vscode shortcuts plus vim commands is cool
  - working with terminal
    - C - a toggle remap
- conclusion
  - loving modal editing, weird typing normally elsewhere
  - always learning, growing support of vsvim will only get better
  - looked at Oni and spacemacs
