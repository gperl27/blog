Hello! My name is Greg Perlman and I work as a software engineer at Flexshopper in South Florida, where I mainly work on many of our backend microservices. I like to spend my time learning, playing piano, and hacking at some [side projects](/projects).

## Personal Stuff
I love music, both listening and playing. I've found there are many similarities between music and programming, and am always looking at ways to [explore them](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/symphonics/igehhhilgkafagloijklhimkkojkkdmi). 

From Pink Floyd to John Coltrane, there are too many artists that I could list as my favorites.

I pretty much eat anything, but lately I've been a sucker for Peruvian food. 

I thoroughly enjoy reading and am trying to catch up on as many classics as I can. Lately I've read *The Last Lecture*, *Slaughterhouse Five*, and *Brave New World*. I'm currently reading *Adventures of Huckleberry Fin*.
